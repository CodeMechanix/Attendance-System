## Software Setup

**Step 2.1: Install Python**

The code in this article is built using Python version 3.6.4 Although there are multiple ways to install Python, I would recommend using Anaconda – the most popular Python distribution for data science.

**Step 2.2: Install OpenCV**

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library aimed at building computer vision applications. It has numerous pre-written functions for image processing tasks. To install OpenCV, do a pip install of the library:
```
      pip3 install opencv-python
```
**Step 2.3: Install face_recognition API**

Finally, we will use face_recognition, dubbed as the world’s simplest facial recognition API for Python. To install:
```
    pip install dlib
    pip install face_recognition
```
